# Forecasting-Directional-movements-of-stock-

This project aims to forecast the directional movements of stock prices using advanced technical analysis techniques. By combining **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)**, **Elliott Waves**, **Fibonacci Retracements**, **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**, and various **chart patterns**, this project develops a framework for predicting market trends and identifying potential trading opportunities.

## Key Techniques Used

- **SMC (Smart Money Concepts):** Understanding institutional market moves and identifying significant buying or selling pressures.
- **Elliott Waves:** Using wave theory to identify market cycles and predict future price movements.
- **Fibonacci Retracements:** Identifying key support and resistance areas based on Fibonacci levels.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Measuring momentum and detecting overbought or oversold conditions to forecast market reversals.
- **Chart Patterns:** Recognizing common chart formations such as head & shoulders, triangles, etc., to predict market behavior.

## Objectives

- Build a reliable system for predicting stock market trends and price movements.
- Detect potential **bullish** and **bearish** trends using technical analysis.
- Provide deeper insights into **price action**, **momentum**, and **market sentiment**.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Analyzing historical stock price data.
- **Technical Indicators:** Implementing technical indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, RSI, and more.
- **Market Visualization:** Visualizing stock price trends and predicted movements.
- **Backtesting:** Testing the accuracy of predictions against historical market data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `Pandas` & `Numpy` for data manipulation
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` for data visualization
  - `TA-Lib` for technical analysis
- **Data Source:** Historical stock price data (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
